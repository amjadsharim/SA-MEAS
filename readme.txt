This code is a SA-MASAS software that allows users to enter a mathematical expression and analyze it using the SymPy library in Python. The program utilizes the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the user.

To run the code, ensure that you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries: tkinter, sympy, and pyttsx3. You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install tkinter
pip install sympy
pip install pyttsx3
Once the dependencies are installed, save the code in a Python file with a ".py" extension (e.g., analyze_expression.py) and execute it.

Upon running the program, a GUI window will appear with an input field labeled "Enter an expression." Here, you can input a mathematical expression, such as "x^2 + 3x - 2". After entering the expression, click the "Analyze" button.

The program will then analyze the expression by performing the following steps:

Create a symbol for the variable in the expression.
Determine the type of expression (quadratic, linear, or multivariable) based on the number of variables present.
Get the factors, terms, constants, and variables in the expression using the SymPy library.
If the expression has only one variable, find the solutions using the SymPy solve() function.
Generate a summary string that includes the expression, expression type, total terms, factors, constants, variables, and solutions.
Print the summary on the console.
Perform speech synthesis using the pyttsx3 library to speak the summary aloud.
Note: The speech synthesis functionality requires a working text-to-speech engine on your system.
