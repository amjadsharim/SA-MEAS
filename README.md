SA-MEAS (Sympy-based Automated Mathematical Equations Analysis and Solver)

SA-MEAS is a user-friendly mathematical equation analysis system designed with a focus on accessibility for visually impaired users. This system allows users to input mathematical expressions or equations either by typing or speaking, and it provides a spoken analysis of the input.
Features:
•Input Methods:
      •	Typing: Users can type mathematical expressions or equations directly into the input box.
      •	Speaking: Users can input expressions or equations by speaking into the system. Press Ctrl+S to activate speech input.
•Analysis:
      •	The system analyzes the input for terms, factors, constants, and variables.
      •	It categorizes equations based on their degree (constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.).
      •	Provides detailed analysis results in the output screen.
      •	Special Character Mapping:
      •	Special characters are mapped to spoken words for a more intuitive user experience.
      •	For example, "^" is spoken as "power," and "=" is spoken as "equals."
•Guidelines:
      •	Press Ctrl+G to hear guidelines on how to use the system effectively.
Usage:
1.Typing Input:
      •	Type the mathematical expression or equation in the input box.
      •	Press Enter to listen to the entered expression.
      •	Press Ctrl+A to analyze the terms, factors, constants, and variables.
2.Speaking Input:
      •	Press Ctrl+S to activate speech input.
      •	Speak the mathematical expression or equation clearly.
      •	The system will process the spoken input and provide analysis results.
3.	Exiting the System:
      •	Press Ctrl+E to exit the SA-MEAS system.
Output Screen:
      • The analysis results, including terms, factors, constants, and variables, are displayed in the output screen. The system also categorizes equations based on their degree and provides solutions when applicable.

Note:
This interface is specifically designed to cater to the needs of visually impaired users, offering a comprehensive and accessible solution for mathematical equation analysis. It aims to make mathematical tasks more manageable through a combination of spoken feedback and intuitive input methods.
